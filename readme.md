# ACF Cleaner

A stupid simple plugin that will clean up unused ACF meta fields.

Remove post or meta data that's been abandoned by a deleted ACF field.

## Installation

Download as .zip and drop into your plugins folder. Install, and it's available under Tools

## Coming Soon Features

* Cleanup of code and slight re-organization.
* Deletion of term and comment meta.
* Nicer layout.
* Addition of nonce
* Check against local ACF json includes (currently database saves only).
  

## Disclaimer

I quickly threw this together and is not yet toughly tested. Backup your database first.
